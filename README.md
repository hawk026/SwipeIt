# SwipeIt
The fast, fun way to clean your photo gallery.

Tired of seeing the "Storage Full" notification? Is your camera roll cluttered with duplicates, screenshots, and blurry photos?

SwipeIt transforms the boring chore of cleaning your phone's gallery into a fast, simple, and even fun experience.

We use a simple, swipe-based interface (like your favorite dating app!) to help you quickly decide what to keep and what to delete. Stop spending hours scrolling and tapping—reclaim your valuable storage in minutes.




✨ Key Features

👆 Simple Swipe Interface Quickly fly through your photos. Swipe one way to keep a photo, swipe the other to send it to the trash. It’s that easy!

📂 Clean Any Folder Don't just clean your camera roll. SwipeIt lets you add any folder on your device—like your Screenshots, Downloads, or WhatsApp Images folders—and clean them out just as easily.

🔍 Find Duplicates Our built-in duplicate finder helps you hunt down identical and similar-looking photos that are wasting precious space.

🗑️ Safe Delete with Trash Never worry about accidental deletions. Photos you remove are first moved to the SwipeIt trash, giving you a chance to review them one last time before you permanently free up space.

✨ Modern & Fast UI A clean, beautiful, and responsive interface that makes the task of organizing your photos simple and satisfying.

Stop letting a cluttered gallery slow you down. Reclaim your storage, organize your memories, and rediscover the joy of a clean photo library.
